  - subtest: This test validates that we don't get stuck in an infinite loop searching
      for a focusable element in the extending focusgroup that wraps that doesn't
      contain one. Wrapping should only be allowed in the focusgroup that contains
      the focusable element we started on or in one of its ancestors.
    test: does-not-wrap-in-focusgroup-with-no-items.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on a focusgroup item which happens to also be an
      extending focusgroup, an arrow key press should move the focus to the next item
      within the extending focusgroup and skip non-focusable items.
    test: moves-inside-extending-focusgroup.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on a focusgroup item, an arrow key press should
      move the focus to the next item and skip non-focusable items.
    test: moves-to-next-item-and-skips-non-focusable.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on a focusgroup item which happens to also be an
      extending focusgroup, an arrow key press should move the focus to the next item
      within the extending focusgroup and skip non-focusable items. If no valid candidate
      is found within that extending focusgroup, the next element (in pre-order traversal)
      should be considered. In this case, |item4| is the valid next candidate.
    test: moves-to-next-item-outside-extending-focusgroup.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on a focusgroup item that is an ancestor to an
      extending focusgroup, the focus should move to the next element inside that
      extending focusgroup even if it's not a direct child.
    test: moves-to-next-item-within-descendants.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on a focusgroup item, an arrow key press should
      move the focus to the next item.
    test: moves-to-next-item.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on the last item of a focusgroup that supports
      wrapping in the axis of the arrow key pressed and the first item is in an inner
      focusgroup that supports it too, the focus moves to that item in the inner focusgroup.
    test: wraps-and-goes-into-inner-focusgroup.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on the last item of a focusgroup that supports
      wrapping in the axis of the arrow key pressed, the focus should move back to
      the first item.
    test: wraps-successfully.html
  - subtest: When the focus is set on the last item of an inner focusgroup that supports
      wrapping while its parent focusgroup also does, the focus should move to the
      first item of the parent focusgroup.
